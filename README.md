## Motivation

We love LINQPad, but we also miss its tremendous utility when not working on Windows. This
is an effort to develop an open-source, web-enabled, cross-platform alternative.

The goal isn't to reach 100% feature parity with LINQPad, but to offer an acceptable alternative that covers the
features developers most commonly need, and if we're lucky, a few new useful ones!

#### If you like the project, please star it :star2:!

## What does it do?

NetPad is a C# playground. It is the quickest way to run some C# code without the ceremonies of creating and managing projects. 
As soon as you open NetPad you'll be presented with the editor right away. Write some C# code, hit Run and see your output. That's it.

- Prototyping and testing code before you incorporate it into your projects.
- Experiment with C# features that you haven't used before. NetPad is a great way to start learning C#.
- Query databases using LINQ or SQL.
- Create and save your own utility or administration scripts.
- Visualize Data in an interactive interface.

## Requirements

The following must be be installed to use NetPad:

* [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (v6 or greater)

Additional requirements only if you plan to create and use database connections:

* [.NET 6 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (not needed if .NET 6 SDK is installed)
* [EF Core tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet) (.NET 5 or later)

## Download

[Download](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad/releases) the latest version for free!

For folks on **Arch Linux** or **Manjaro**, you can also install it from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/netpad-bin).

On **macOS** see [this](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad/wiki/Troubleshooting#netpad-is-damaged-and-cant-be-opened-you-should-move-it-to-the-trash) if you have trouble opening NetPad.

## Updates

NetPad checks for updates on startup and will let you know when a new version is available.
While it cannot _yet_ install the latest update automatically, that feature will be introduced.

The latest version can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/tareqimbasher/NetPad/releases) page.

## Tech Stack :computer:

* .NET
* Electron.NET ([github](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET))
* Aurelia 2 ([docs](https://docs.aurelia.io/))

### How it works: In a nutshell

NetPad runs an ASP.NET web app that hosts a web-based user interface. It can be
packaged as an Electron desktop app or served and accessed on any browser.

Communication between the user interface and the ASP.NET backend occurs via HTTP
and SignalR.

## Build

This section describes how to build and run NetPad from source.
NetPad can be run as an Electron desktop app or as a web application
accessed with a web browser.

### Requirements

* Node v16+ (npm v8+)
* .NET SDK 7.x
* EF Core tools 5.x or later

### NetPad as an Electron desktop app

#### 1. Run the SPA

```
# Install dependencies
cd src/Apps/NetPad.Apps.App/ElectronHostHook
npm install

cd ../App
npm install

# Start the development web server
npm start
```

#### 2. Run the .NET app

Install the Electron.NET CLI tool:

```
dotnet tool install ElectronNET.CLI -g
```

Start the app:

```
cd src/Apps/NetPad.Apps.App

# Start in watch mode (remove '/watch' to run without watch mode)
electronize start /watch /manifest electron.manifest.dev.js

# For macOS ARM, append the following to the 'electronize start' command
/target custom "osx-arm64;mac" /electron-arch arm64
```

###### Note

> Only the very first `electronize start` is slow. Later runs are much faster.

### NetPad as a Web app (accessed from a browser)

#### 1. Run the SPA

```
# Install dependencies
cd src/Apps/NetPad.Apps.App/App
npm install

# Start the development web server
npm run start-web
```

#### 2. Run the .NET app

```
cd src/Apps/NetPad.Apps.App
dotnet watch run --environment Development
```

and access the app via your web browser, ex: `http://localhost:57930`

## Packaging :package:

The Electron app is built and packaged using
[electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/). Configuration is in the `electron.manifest.js` file.

Build the app for the desired platform from the root directory of the `NetPad.Apps.App` project:

```
# For x64:
electronize build /target win /manifest electron.manifest.js /PublishSingleFile false
electronize build /target osx /manifest electron.manifest.js /PublishSingleFile false
electronize build /target linux /manifest electron.manifest.js /PublishSingleFile false

# For macOS ARM:
electronize build /target custom "osx-arm64;mac" /electron-arch arm64 /manifest electron.manifest.js /PublishSingleFile false
```

Packaged files can be found in the `bin/Desktop` folder.

###### Note

> Alternatively, on Linux, the `/scripts/package-electron.sh` script can be used
> to package the Electron app, in which case packaged files can be found in
> the `/dist/` folder.


See the [Electron.NET docs](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET#-build)
for additional CLI options when packaging the app,
and [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) for additional configuration
options.
